<h2 id="font-color">My Fav country!!</h2>
        <br>
	<p>Well my fav country is obviously MALAYSIA HAHAHA. To me, no matter where I go in the world, my heart still in Malaysia my own beautiful country in its own way. Even tho Malaysia nature is different that Europe country, Malaysia has diversity in landscapes, culture and activities. From walking around Penang’s UNESCO-listed George Town and Malacca’s historical core, to exploring isolated islands and spending time in Borneo’s 130-million-year old jungle, tourists have plenty of places to visit in Malaysia. Here are our favourites. </p>
	<!--Kuala Lumpur-->

	<p id="special" align="justify" id="red"><a href="http://www.kuala-lumpur.ws/attractions/10-things-to-see.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/kl/portals/kuala-lumpur-ws/homepage/pagePropertiesOgImage/kuala-lumpur.jpg" alt="Best country" style="float:left;width:500px;padding: 10px"></a>
	Well this is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Malaysia. Over 8 million people live within the greater KL area which is clearly noticeable by the huge and vast amounts of traffic that goes into the city every morning, and slowly leaves the city in the evening. Kuala Lumpur has many interesting attractions; like Merdeka Square, Chinatown, Petronas Twin Towers and much more. KL is also known as a shoppers paradise; there are are numerous huge shopping malls where you can literally shop till you drop.</p>
